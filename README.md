# prework-study-guide webpage
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I built this project so as a bootcamp student, I would have the prework
notes structured on a webpage.  This project solves the problem of not having a structured space to put in my notes for the bootcamp.  I learned quite a bit about the processes involved to create a webpage.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review teh notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
